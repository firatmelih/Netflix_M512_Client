Netflix Client Side

Made by Melih FÄ±rat.
In this Front-End App React, Redux, MaterialUI, SCSS are used.

UI Developments are self producted without using any library or help or inspiration from anothers.

Obviously UI Design adopted by original Netflix.

Also for localization I used self producted algorithm instead of I18n.
